# TM_Backend
 
In order to run this you need to do the following

1. Install Spring Boot and all it's usual components
2. You'll need a local DB, I used MySQL Workbench with a simple DB with one (1) table in it, you can check configuration in application.properties for details on the DB
3. Run the application, if all goes well you will get a similar message as below
   2m2023-11-29 14:00:08.213 s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet       0;39m 2m:0;39m Completed initialization in 1 ms

4. Once you are up and running, you should be able to run tests on the application using Postman or the frontend for this app (frontend code : https://github.com/EmilioJags/TM_Frontend)
5. Enjoy
